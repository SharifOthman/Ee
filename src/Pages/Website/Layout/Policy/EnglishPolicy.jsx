              <p>
                Some external parties collect information about users of our
                services to provide interest-based advertising displayed on our
                services and other places, including across browsers and
                devices. These external parties may use the information
                collected on our services to make predictions about your
                interests for the purpose of providing you with (from us or
                other companies) online ads. Some external parties participate
                in an industry system that allows users to opt-out of receiving
                ads designed based on their online activities. Due to
                differences in the use of applications and websites on mobile
                devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable
                targeted advertising techniques in mobile applications. Many
                mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising from
                mobile applications using the settings included in the mobile
                application or your mobile device. For more information, please
                check your mobile device settings. You can also uninstall our
                applications using the standard uninstall process available on
                your mobile device or in the app store.

                We do not allow, knowingly, non-specialists and academics to
